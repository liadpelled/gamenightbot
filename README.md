# gamenightbot
A Telegram bot used for our board game group. It was added to our game night Telegram group, and everyone can use it to:
- Find out who won the last time we played a certain game
- Get info on a specific game
The data is fetched from the BoardGameGeek website, using its database of games and saved game entries that we upload manually through an app.
